# Contacts CLI

## What you will need
This aplication runs on the [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).

## How to setup
You can either clone this rep or download the binnary from the [releases tab](https://github.com/pikachuface/CMDContacts/releases).

## How to use
It's pretty straight forward, the only time, that you may be confused is when you need to delete contact. That's done in the **search mode** you have to insert to the serach bar the id of the contact, or jsut search until there will be just one contact and then you have to press **Ctrl+D**. After that the deletion promt will pop up.
